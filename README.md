# Fast-Fourier-Transform-MATLAB-Implementation

The basic objective of this project is to use the Fast Fourier transform to convert a signal from 
the time domain to the frequency domain(spectrum) and its phase spectrum and it was 
successfully build using MATLAB. 

Based on the fundamental theory of the Fourier transform, the code is arranged so we can obtain 
3 graphs at the same time, with the possibility of choosing the type of wave, and also inserting 
the 3 parameters of the signal, the amplitude, the frequency and the length
